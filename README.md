A full-featured React application for tracking ELO ratings in a table tennis league. Add players, record match results, and watch ELO ratings update in real-time!

## Features

- **Player Management**: Add players to the league with starting ELO of 1500
- **Match Recording**: Record match results with scores for each player
- **Real-time ELO Updates**: ELO ratings automatically recalculate after each match
- **Leaderboard**: View players ranked by ELO with win/loss statistics
- **Match History**: Browse all past matches with ELO changes
- **SQLite Database**: All data is stored in a SQLite database
- **Match Deletion**: Delete matches with automatic ELO recalculation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start both the backend server and frontend:
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This will start:
- Backend API server on `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend React app on `http://localhost:5173`

Alternatively, you can run them separately:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend server
npm run dev:server

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## How to Use

### Adding Players

1. Navigate to the "👤 Add Player" tab
2. Enter a player name
3. Click "Add Player"
4. New players start with an ELO rating of 1500

### Recording Matches

1. Navigate to the "➕ Add Match" tab
2. Select Player 1 and Player 2 from the dropdowns
3. Enter the scores for each player
4. Click "Add Match"
5. ELO ratings will update automatically!

### Viewing the Leaderboard

The "🏆 Leaderboard" tab shows:
- Player rankings (sorted by ELO)
- Current ELO rating
- Win/Loss record
- Win percentage
- Total matches played

### Viewing Match History

The "📊 History" tab displays:
- All past matches in chronological order
- Match scores
- ELO ratings before and after each match
- ELO change for each player
- Option to delete matches

## ELO Calculation

The app uses the standard ELO rating system:
- Starting ELO: 1500
- K-factor: 32 (standard for most competitive play)
- Formula: `New Rating = Old Rating + K × (Actual Score - Expected Score)`

Expected score is calculated using:
```
Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((Opponent Rating - Player Rating) / 400))
```

## Data Storage

All data is stored in a **SQLite database** located at `server/database.sqlite`:
- Players table: Stores player information and statistics
- Matches table: Stores match history with ELO changes

The database is automatically created when you first run the server. Data persists between server restarts.

### Database Schema

**Players Table:**
- `id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
- `name` (TEXT UNIQUE)
- `elo` (INTEGER, default 1500)
- `wins` (INTEGER, default 0)
- `losses` (INTEGER, default 0)
- `matches_played` (INTEGER, default 0)
- `created_at` (TEXT)

**Matches Table:**
- `id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
- `player1_id`, `player2_id` (TEXT, foreign keys)
- `player1_name`, `player2_name` (TEXT)
- `player1_score`, `player2_score` (INTEGER)
- `player1_elo_before`, `player2_elo_before` (INTEGER)
- `player1_elo_after`, `player2_elo_after` (INTEGER)
- `player1_elo_change`, `player2_elo_change` (INTEGER)
- `created_at` (TEXT)

## API Endpoints

The backend provides REST API endpoints:

- `GET /api/players` - Get all players
- `POST /api/players` - Add a new player
- `DELETE /api/players/:id` - Delete a player
- `GET /api/matches` - Get all matches
- `POST /api/matches` - Add a new match
- `DELETE /api/matches/:id` - Delete a match (recalculates ELO)
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
